# OOP Study Guide Documentation Prompt

Use this prompt template whenever you want to refactor and document a topic in your OOP learning journey.

---

## 📝 PROMPT TEMPLATE

```
I need you to refactor and document my code for the topic: **[TOPIC_NAME]**

Language: [cpp/ts/java]
Code Location: [PATH_TO_CODE_FILE]

Please analyze my existing code and:

1. **Refactor the code** following the style demonstrated in `oop-fundamentals/enum/`:
   - Add clear section markers with visual separators (=======)
   - Include numbered sections (1., 2., 3., etc.)
   - Add descriptive comments explaining each concept
   - Show multiple practical examples (basic, intermediate, advanced)
   - Include comparisons with other language styles when relevant
   - Add a complete demonstration/main function

2. **Create a comprehensive README.md** with this structure:
   - Title: [Topic] in [Language] — A Complete Practical Guide
   - Brief introduction and when to use it
   - Multiple numbered sections covering:
     * Basic concepts
     * Common patterns
     * Advanced usage
     * Comparisons with other languages
     * Best practices
     * Common pitfalls
     * Real-world use cases
   - Summary table comparing approaches
   - Final takeaways with core insights
   - Reference links to authoritative sources

3. **Follow these formatting guidelines**:
   - Use markdown with code blocks
   - Include emoji indicators: ✅ (good), ❌ (bad), ⚠️ (warning)
   - Use blockquotes (>) for key insights
   - Create comparison tables when appropriate
   - Keep explanations concise but comprehensive
   - Use practical, relatable examples

4. **Quality standards**:
   - All code must compile and run
   - Comments explain "why" not just "what"
   - Cover edge cases and common mistakes
   - Show evolution from basic to advanced
   - Compare with equivalent patterns in other OOP languages
   - Include theoretical context

Important: Match the style, depth, and comprehensiveness of:
- `oop-fundamentals/enum/cpp/enum.cpp`
- `oop-fundamentals/enum/cpp/README.md`
- `oop-fundamentals/enum/ts/enum.ts`
- `oop-fundamentals/enum/ts/README.md`
```

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE GUIDELINES

Before using the prompt, understand the structure:

### **Core Principle**

> One topic = One comprehensive code file + One README per language

### **When to Use ONE File (Default)**

Most OOP concepts fit in a single comprehensive file (~100-200 lines):

- ✅ Encapsulation
- ✅ Interface
- ✅ Abstract Classes
- ✅ Enum (your perfect example!)
- ✅ Operator Overloading
- ✅ Composition
- ✅ Constructor/Destructor
- ✅ Static Members

### **When to Split into Subtopics (RARE)**

Only split when:

1. **File would be > 300 lines** and unwieldy
2. **Natural conceptual divisions** exist (compile-time vs runtime)
3. **Genuinely massive topic** like Polymorphism or Inheritance

**Examples that warrant splitting:**

```
polymorphism/
├── cpp/
│   ├── compile-time-polymorphism.cpp    # Function/operator overloading, templates
│   ├── runtime-polymorphism.cpp          # Virtual functions, inheritance
│   └── README.md                         # ONE README covering both

inheritance/
├── cpp/
│   ├── single-inheritance.cpp
│   ├── multiple-inheritance.cpp
│   ├── diamond-problem.cpp
│   └── README.md                         # ONE README covering all
```

### **README Strategy**

- **Always ONE README per topic per language**
- Even with multiple code files, write ONE unified README
- README should reference all code files in that directory
- Structure README with sections for each code file
- README should be like a technical blog/tutorial, try to explain sections, subsection and code examples in brief paragraphs or points if needed be.

### **Decision Matrix**

| Question                 | Action                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Different OOP concept?   | ✅ New topic directory  |
| Main file > 300 lines?   | ✅ Split into subtopics |
| Natural divisions exist? | ✅ Split into subtopics |
| Just another example?    | ❌ Add to main file     |
| Helper/utility code?     | ❌ Include in main file |

## 🎯 EXAMPLE USAGE

### For a new topic (Interface in C++)

```
I need you to refactor and document my code for the topic: **Interface**

Language: cpp
Code Location: /mnt/data/learning/lld/oop-fundamentals/interface/cpp/interface.cpp

[Include the full prompt above]
```

### For adding a new language to existing topic

```
I need you to refactor and document my code for the topic: **Enum**

Language: java
Code Location: /mnt/data/learning/lld/oop-fundamentals/enum/java/enum.java

Note: I already have C++ and TypeScript documented. Please maintain consistency
with those implementations while highlighting Java-specific features.

[Include the full prompt above]
```

## 🔄 WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

This prompt is integrated into the workflow: `/refactor-and-document`

To use the workflow:

1. **Write your code** in the appropriate directory:
   - Format: `oop-fundamentals/[topic]/[language]/[topic].[ext]`
   - Example: `oop-fundamentals/polymorphism/cpp/polymorphism.cpp`

2. **Run the workflow**:

   ```
   /refactor-and-document
   ```

   Then provide the topic name and language when prompted.

3. **Review and iterate**:
   - Check the refactored code
   - Review the README.md
   - Request adjustments if needed

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE

### Directory Structure

```
oop-fundamentals/
├── [topic]/
│   ├── cpp/
│   │   ├── [topic].cpp
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── ts/
│   │   ├── [topic].ts

```

### Expected README Length

- **200-250 lines** of comprehensive documentation
- Theoretical + Practical balance
- Multiple examples and comparisons

### Code File Structure

- **100-150 lines** of well-commented code
- 5-7 major sections
- Complete runnable examples
- Demonstration/main function

---

## 💡 TIPS

1. **Before documenting**:
   - Ensure your code compiles
   - Run it to verify it works
   - Think about what concepts you want to highlight

2. **During documentation**:
   - Reference existing documented topics for consistency
   - Ask for specific examples if needed
   - Request comparisons with other languages

3. **After documentation**:
   - Read through the README
   - Run the refactored code
   - Check if all concepts are clear
   - Update if you discover new insights
